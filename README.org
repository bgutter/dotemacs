#+TITLE: Brandon's Emacs Configuration

* Who Should Use This?

No one should use this. It's not a starter-kit. [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/StarterKits][Here are some starter kits,]] but I'd strongly recommend just using plain emacs and customizing it incrementally.

This repo is for reference & personal use only, and because I'm sure at least some parts of it will end up being useful to someone somewhere.

* How do I use it anyway?

Clone this repo (or, better, your fork of it) to =~/.emacs.d/emacs-config=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/bgutter/dotemacs.git emacs-config
#+END_SRC

Copy =example-init.el= up into =~/.emacs.d/init.el=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd emacs-config
  cp ./example-init.el ../init.el
  cp ./early-init.el ../early-init.el
#+END_SRC

If you want to keep your existing customizations, copy them out of your existing =init.el= (or =.emacs=) and into =~/.emacs.d/emacs-config/custom.el=.

Run Emacs. Enjoy.

See [[./my-init.org][the init file itself]] for more complete documentation!

* Troubleshooting and Other Advice

** I still have vanilla emacs

If things aren't working, make sure that =emacs= found the correct initialization directory. Arch and Windows seem to work out of the box. Ubuntu requires =~/.config/emacs= to be deleted (yeah, I know, XDG etc ðŸ¤·).

The variable =user-init-file= can be used to determine which initialization directory is in use. Type =C-h v=, then enter =user-init-file=, and hit enter. You want it to say =/home/you/.emacs.d/init.el=.

** Don't track custom.el

Run this to keep changes in =custom.el= from being tracked by git.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/.emacs.d/emacs-config
git update-index --assume-unchanged custom.el
#+END_SRC
